        <p>Cyber Security &amp; Safety<span style="font-family: sans-serif">&trade;</span> aims to educate you on the various kinds of cybercrimes, how to understand them and how you can protect yourself from them.</p>
        <p>This site was created with these goals in mind and was made primarily to educate the older generation of internet users, for this age group are usually more likely to fall prey to becoming victims of these kinds of crimes. It's encouraged to share this website with the older people in your life, so they have a reliable source to go to so they remain informed about the dangers of cybercrimes.</p>
        <horizline></horizline>
        <p>The site is split into three different webpages, each of which can be accessed via the navigation bar at the top. The first page is "Home", which links to this page that you're on right now. The second page, "About Cybercrimes", will contain some information about cybercrimes, including their history and what diffgerent kinds of cybercrimes there are that can affect you.</p>
        <p>The third page, "Tips &amp; Tricks" will provide you with information, tips and tricks about how you can defend yourself from cybercrimes before they happen so you don't become victim to one, and how you can protect your information after a cyber crime. Finally, the fourth page will discuss employment opportunities for those who wish to make cybercrimes less likely on the internet.</p>
