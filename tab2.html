        <p>Cybercrimes are any crime that are committed using the internet. Cybercrimes can be committed by either a human or a computer depending on the crime, and are relatively easy to get away with if you're in a country that is not your victim's. This is because many cybercrimes are performed by not a single person but an entire group of people, that could be spread across the entire world which only makes finding out who did it more difficult.</p>
		    
        <p>Most forms of cybercrimes come in viruses. These are programs on your computer that are created with the main goal of damaging your computer or the files on it. Things like weird emails from people you've never heard of that contain an odd link or a file are viruses. So are "free" programs that you'd usually have to pay for in order to use. A safe rule to go by on the Internet is "If it's too good to be true, it probably isn't."</p>
        
        <p>Cybercrimes don't just come in the form of viruses, however. Humans can commit cybercrimes as well, although not with the intention to damage your computer. Instead, cybercrimes committed by humans usually come with the intention to attack their victims directly, damaging their reputation and online presence usually by posing as them online and saying negative things. This is one of the most effective ways to commit a cybercrime, as it directly puts your victim in a negative light and makes them look bad online.</p>

        <p>The very first computer virus ever created was not actually created with any malicious intent. It was called the "Creeper Virus" and infected 5.2 inch floppy disks back in 1971. All the program did was display the words "<span style="font-family: monospace">CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.</span>" No harm done.</p>
        
        <p>The next virus, called the Rabbit or "Wabbit" virus developed in 1974, did have malicious intent. It duplicated itself over and over again on the computer, greatly reducing the performance of the computer to the point where it simply could not run at all. It was given the name "Rabbit Virus" because of how fast it did its job.</p>
        
        <p>The "ILOVEYOU" virus was the very first email virus to surface, having been created in 1995. It looked like a simple text file but was actually a VBS file, which is a type of computer script file. When someone clicked on the virus, which was named <span style="font-family: monospace">ILOVEYOU.TXT<span style="background-color: red; color: white">.VBS</span></span>, every file on their computer would be replaced by a copy of it included the files required to make the computer even start. In turn the virus would email it to everyone in your email address book so it would spread.</p>
