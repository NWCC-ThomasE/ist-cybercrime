        <p>While it may seem that cybercrimes are things you can't defend yourself from, there are lots of ways to keep yourself protected so you don't fall prey to an online attacker.</p>

        <h3>Protecting yourself against Viruses</h3>
        <p>Viruses come in the form of emails or suspicious looking programs that you download from the internet. Usually anti-virus software (if you have one installed) will immediately pop up and tell you that the virus has been detected and will delete it automatically, but in some cases the virus can slip past the program. In this case you could use common sense and apply the tried and true rule: "If it's too good to be true, it probably is." Delete it if it seems too good to be legitimate.</p>

        <h3>Protecting your Information Online</h3>
        <p>Even if you stay protected against viruses your information can still be compromised. Your online accounts can be hacked and deleted, rendering your information inaccessible. You can stop this by constantly changing the passwords of your accounts and using different passwords for each account. This keeps online attackers from using your passwords to compromise your accounts.</p>

        <h3>Protecting your Identity Online</h3>
        <p>One of the easiest forms of cybercrime is damaging one's identity. You don't even need to be hacked for this, anyone can create a social media account with your name and your face and use that to put you in a negative light online. While being one of the easiest forms of cybercrime to commit it's one of the tougher ones to defend yourself from. The best you could do to protect your identity is ensure that everyone who knows you online <b>KNOWS</b> that you are who you are, and anyone else using your name and image on a separate account is not you. The next best option is to tell your local police that someone is trying to impersonate you online and put you in a negative light.</p>
